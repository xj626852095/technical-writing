# E-Commerce Platform

> A scalable microservices-based e-commerce platform

## Overview

E-Commerce Platform is a production-ready, scalable online marketplace built using a microservices architecture. The system handles thousands of concurrent users, processes millions of transactions, and provides real-time inventory management and order processing.

The platform is designed for high availability, with horizontal scaling capabilities, distributed data management, and event-driven communication between services.

## Architecture

The system follows an event-driven microservices architecture with API Gateway pattern:

<img src="docs/images/architecture-2.png" style="max-width:50%;" />

The system consists of 4 core functional modules:
- **User Management** - Authentication, authorization, and user profiles
- **Product Catalog** - Product search, categorization, and inventory display
- **Order Processing** - Cart, checkout, and order lifecycle management
- **Payment Processing** - Payment gateway integration and transaction handling

For detailed architecture documentation, see individual module documentation.

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/example/ecommerce-platform.git
cd ecommerce-platform

# Start infrastructure services
docker-compose up -d postgres redis rabbitmq elasticsearch

## FAQ

### What happens when a service goes down?

The system is designed for high availability. If a service goes down:
- API Gateway returns 503 Service Unavailable
- Message queues buffer messages until service recovers
- Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures
- Health checks trigger automatic restarts

### How is data consistency maintained?

We use eventual consistency for distributed transactions:
- Sagas for order processing workflow
- Event sourcing for inventory updates
- Compensating transactions for rollbacks
- Periodic reconciliation jobs

### Can I add a new payment gateway?

Yes! See [Payment Processing Module](modules/payment-processing/) for details.
