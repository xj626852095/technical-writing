# E-Commerce Platform

> A scalable microservices-based e-commerce platform

## Overview

E-Commerce Platform is a production-ready, scalable online marketplace built using a microservices architecture. The system handles thousands of concurrent users, processes millions of transactions, and provides real-time inventory management and order processing.

The platform is designed for high availability, with horizontal scaling capabilities, distributed data management, and event-driven communication between services.

## Architecture

The system follows an event-driven microservices architecture with API Gateway pattern:

### Architecture Decisions

**Why Microservices Architecture?**

The platform uses microservices to enable independent development, deployment, and scaling of business capabilities:

- **Team autonomy:** Each service can be owned and developed by independent teams
- **Technology diversity:** Services use optimal languages (Node.js, Python, Go) for their requirements
- **Fault isolation:** Failure in one service doesn't crash the entire platform
- **Independent scaling:** High-traffic services (e.g., Product Catalog) can scale without affecting others

*Trade-off:* Increased operational complexity. We mitigate this with Docker, standardized deployment patterns, and comprehensive monitoring.

**Why Event-Driven Communication?**

Services communicate asynchronously via message queues (RabbitMQ) for loose coupling:

- **Decoupling:** Services don't need to know about each other's APIs or availability
- **Resilience:** Messages are buffered when services are down, preventing data loss
- **Scalability:** Multiple consumers can process messages in parallel
- **Auditability:** All service interactions are logged via message events

*Trade-off:* Eventually consistent data model. Critical paths use Sagas with compensating transactions to ensure consistency.

**Why API Gateway Pattern?**

Kong API Gateway serves as the single entry point for all client requests:

- **Centralized concerns:** Authentication, rate limiting, and routing handled in one place
- **Protocol translation:** Clients use HTTP/REST while backend services may use different protocols
- **Service abstraction:** Internal service changes don't affect client integrations
- **Cross-cutting features:** CORS, logging, and metrics applied uniformly

**Why Database per Service?**

Each service owns its database schema and data access:

- **Autonomy:** Teams can evolve their data models without coordinating with other teams
- **Technology fit:** Services use optimal databases (PostgreSQL for relational, Redis for caching, Elasticsearch for search)
- **Fault containment:** Database issues in one service don't affect others
- **Independent deployment:** Schema changes don't require coordinated deployments

**Why Polyglot Services?**

Different services use different languages based on their requirements:

| Service | Language | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| User Service | Node.js + Express | Fast I/O, good auth ecosystem, shares code with frontend |
| Product Service | Python + FastAPI | Data processing libraries, fast development, async support |
| Order Service | Node.js + Express | Transactional workflow, shares User service patterns |
| Payment Service | Node.js + Express | Security libraries, PCI-DSS compliance ecosystem |
| Inventory Service | Go | High performance, low latency, efficient concurrency |

### Core Functional Modules

- **User Management** - Authentication, authorization, and user profiles
- **Product Catalog** - Product search, categorization, and inventory display
- **Order Processing** - Cart, checkout, and order lifecycle management
- **Payment Processing** - Payment gateway integration and transaction handling

For detailed architecture documentation, see individual module documentation.

## Tech Stack

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** - 20.x or higher
- **Docker Compose** - 2.x or higher
- **Node.js** - 18.x (for local development)
- **Python** - 3.11 (for local development)
- **Go** - 1.21 (for local development)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/example/ecommerce-platform.git
cd ecommerce-platform

# Start infrastructure services
docker-compose up -d postgres redis rabbitmq elasticsearch

# Install dependencies for each service
make install-all

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env

# Initialize databases
make db-migrate

# Start all services
make start-all
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

## FAQ

### What happens when a service goes down?

The system is designed for high availability. If a service goes down:
- API Gateway returns 503 Service Unavailable
- Message queues buffer messages until service recovers
- Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures
- Health checks trigger automatic restarts

### How is data consistency maintained?

We use eventual consistency for distributed transactions:
- Sagas for order processing workflow
- Event sourcing for inventory updates
- Compensating transactions for rollbacks
- Periodic reconciliation jobs

### Can I add a new payment gateway?

Yes! See [Payment Processing Module](docs/modules/payment-processing/) for details.
