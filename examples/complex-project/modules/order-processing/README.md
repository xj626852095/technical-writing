# Order Processing

> Shopping cart, checkout, and order lifecycle management

## Overview

The Order Processing module handles all order-related functionality including shopping cart management, checkout processing, and order lifecycle management. It integrates with payment processing and inventory services through message queue events.

This module is responsible for cart operations, checkout flow orchestration, order status tracking, and order history retrieval.

## Architecture

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Node.js 18.x
- **Framework:** Express
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15
- **Message Queue:** RabbitMQ 3.12
- **State Machine:** Finite state machine for order states

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Cart not persisting
**Solution:** Check JWT token validity and user authentication

**Issue:** Checkout failing at payment step
**Solution:** Verify Payment Service is accessible and API key valid

**Issue:** Order status not updating
**Solution:** Check RabbitMQ connection and event consumer is running

## FAQ

### How are order states managed?

Orders use a finite state machine with states: pending → confirmed → processing → shipped → delivered / cancelled.

### What happens when payment fails?

Cart is preserved, payment failure event is emitted, and user can retry checkout.

### Can users modify orders after placement?

Orders can only be cancelled if in "pending" state. No modifications allowed after confirmation.
