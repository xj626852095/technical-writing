**Step 1: Create quick-start.md**

```markdown
# Quick Start Guide

Get your project documented in 5 minutes.

## Essential README Elements

Every README must have these 5 critical sections:

1. **Title & Description** - What is this project?
2. **Quick Start** - How to get it running immediately
3. **Usage** - How to use it
4. **Configuration** - What can be configured
5. **API/Documentation Links** - Where to learn more

## Choose Your Template

```
Is your project multi-module or distributed?
├── No → Use Simple Project Template
│   └── Single codebase, < 5 main files
└── Yes → Use Complex Project Template
    └── Multiple services, modules, or components
```

## Copy & Get Started

### Simple Project

```bash
# Copy the template
cp resources/templates/readme-simple.md your-project/README.md

# Edit the placeholders
# Replace [BRACKETED_TEXT] with your project details
```

## Task 4: Create Documentation Principles Guide

**Files:**
- Create: `writing-guide/01-principles.md`

**Step 1: Create the principles guide**

```markdown
# Documentation Principles

The foundation of good technical documentation.

## Why Documentation Matters

Good documentation:
- **Reduces onboarding time** - New developers become productive faster
- **Reduces support burden** - Questions are answered before they're asked
- **Captures institutional knowledge** - Knowledge isn't lost when people leave
- **Enables scalability** - Teams can grow without constant hand-holding
- **Improves code quality** - Documentation forces clear thinking

## Reader-First Mindset

Always write with your reader in mind:

### ✅ Good: Reader-focused
```markdown
To deploy the application, run `npm run deploy` from the project root.
```

### ❌ Bad: Writer-focused
```markdown
I usually deploy by running npm run deploy.
```

### Questions to ask before writing:
1. Who is reading this? (New developer? Experienced teammate? External user?)
2. What do they already know?
3. What do they need to accomplish?
4. What might confuse them?

## When to Document

### Must Document:
- Public APIs and interfaces
- Installation and setup procedures
- Architecture decisions and trade-offs
- Configuration options
- Troubleshooting common issues

### Don't Document:
- Implementation details obvious from code
- Comments that repeat what code does (not why)
- Temporary workarounds (fix the code instead)
- Obsolete features (remove them instead)

## The Documentation Pyramid

```
                 │
      Overview ───┤── 1 page, high level
                 │
      Guides ─────┤── 5-10 pages, how-to
                 │
      Reference ──┤── Detailed, lookup
                 │
─────────────────┴─────────────────
```

Start with overview documents, add guides as needed, reference material comes last.

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Assuming too much knowledge
```markdown
# Bad: Assumes reader knows your jargon
Connect to the FLDB and query the UM.
```

```markdown
# Good: Explains terms
Connect to the Feature Database (FLDB) and query the User Management (UM) table.
```

### ❌ Writing novels
```markdown
# Bad: 50 paragraphs before any useful information
The history of authentication begins in ancient times...
```

```markdown
# Good: Gets to the point immediately
## Authentication
This API uses JWT tokens for authentication. Include your token in the Authorization header.
```

### ❌ Being too brief
```markdown
# Bad: One-line command with no context
npm install
```

```markdown
# Good: Explains what and why
# Install dependencies
npm install

This installs all required packages listed in package.json.
```

## Documentation Quality Checklist

Before publishing documentation, verify:
- [ ] Is the purpose clear in the first paragraph?
- [ ] Are all commands copy-pasteable and tested?
- [ ] Are code examples complete and working?
- [ ] Is technical terminology explained or linked?
- [ ] Is the structure logical and scannable?
- [ ] Will this be accurate in 6 months?

## Task 5: Create README Documentation Guide

**Files:**
- Create: `writing-guide/02-readme.md`

**Step 1: Create README guide**

```markdown
# README Documentation

Your project's front door. Make it welcoming.

## Purpose

The README is often the first thing people see. It should answer:
- What is this project?
- Why does it exist?
- How do I get started?
- Where can I learn more?

## Standard README Structure

### For Simple Projects

```markdown
# [Project Name]

[One-line description]

## Overview
[2-3 sentences explaining what the project does and its value]

## Key Features
- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3

## Architecture
[Brief description of how it's structured]

## Tech Stack
- Language/Framework
- Key libraries

## Quick Start
\`\`\`bash
git clone repo
cd project
npm install
npm start
\`\`\`

## Usage
[Basic usage examples]

## Configuration
[Key configuration options]

## Testing
\`\`\`bash
npm test
\`\`\`

## Deployment
[Deployment instructions]

## API Documentation
[Link to detailed API docs if applicable]

## Performance & Scalability
[Performance characteristics, limitations]

## FAQ
**Q: Common question?**
A: Answer
```

### For Complex Projects

Same structure as simple projects, with these additions:
- Link to sub-documentation for detailed sections
- Architecture section links to `docs/architecture.md`
- API section links to `docs/api/` directory
- Include contributor guidelines

## README Best Practices

### ✅ Good Examples

#### Clear Title and Description
```markdown
# ImageCompressor

A lightweight image compression library that reduces file size by 80% while maintaining visual quality.
```

#### Specific, Actionable Features
```markdown
## Key Features
- Compress JPEG, PNG, and WebP formats
- Batch processing support
- Configurable quality levels (1-100)
- Preserve metadata (EXIF, IPTC)
- CLI and programmatic API
```

#### Working Quick Start
```markdown
## Quick Start
\`\`\`bash
# Install
npm install @team/imagecompressor

# Use in code
const compressor = require('@team/imagecompressor');
await compressor.compress('input.jpg', 'output.jpg', { quality: 80 });
\`\`\`
```

### ❌ Bad Examples

#### Vague Description
```markdown
# MyProject

A project that does things.
```

#### Generic Features
```markdown
## Features
- Easy to use
- Fast
- Great performance
```

#### Non-Working Quick Start
```markdown
## Quick Start
npm install
node app.js
# (Note: you need to set up API keys first)
```

## Badges

Use badges sparingly and purposefully:

```markdown
# ProjectName

![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/user/repo/build.yml)
![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/package)
![License](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/package)
```

**Only include badges that:**
- Provide actionable information (build status, version)
- Are relevant to your users (not just vanity metrics)
- Stay current (remove broken badges immediately)

## Screenshots and Demos

For user-facing projects, add a screenshot or GIF after the description:

```markdown
# ProjectName

Brief description.

![Demo](docs/images/demo.gif)

## Key Features
...
```

## Task 6: Create Architecture Documentation Guide

**Files:**
- Create: `writing-guide/03-architecture.md`

**Step 1: Create architecture guide**

```markdown
# Architecture Documentation

Explaining how your system is built and why.

## Purpose

Architecture documentation helps:
- New developers understand the big picture
- Teams make consistent technical decisions
- Future maintainers understand design trade-offs
- Onboarding by providing mental models

## When to Write Architecture Docs

- New project or major feature
- Significant refactoring
- Distributed system design
- Microservices architecture
- Complex data flows

## Architecture Document Structure

### Overview Section

```markdown
# System Architecture

## Overview
[Project Name] is a [type] system that [what it does].

The system consists of [N] main components:
- [Component A] - [Purpose]
- [Component B] - [Purpose]
- [Component C] - [Purpose]
```

### System Diagram

```markdown
## System Overview

![System Overview](images/architecture.png)

The system follows a [pattern name] architecture:
```

### Component Descriptions

```markdown
## Components

### API Gateway
Routes incoming requests to appropriate services.
- **Technology:** Nginx
- **Responsibility:** Request routing, rate limiting, SSL termination

### Auth Service
Handles authentication and authorization.
- **Technology:** Node.js + Passport.js
- **Responsibility:** JWT token issuance, validation

### Data Service
Manages all data operations.
- **Technology:** Python + SQLAlchemy
- **Responsibility:** CRUD operations, data validation
```

### Data Flow

```markdown
## Data Flow

1. Client request → API Gateway
2. API Gateway validates token → Auth Service
3. Auth Service validates → API Gateway
4. API Gateway routes → Data Service
5. Data Service queries → Database
6. Data returns through same path

![Data Flow](images/data-flow.png)
```

### Technology Decisions

```markdown
## Technology Choices

### Why [Technology]?

**Reasons:**
- Reason 1
- Reason 2

**Alternatives Considered:**
- [Alternative A] - Not chosen because [reason]
- [Alternative B] - Not chosen because [reason]
```

## Diagram Best Practices

### ✅ Good Diagram Practices

1. **Show the right level of detail**
   - High-level overview: Show major components only
   - Detailed view: One component at a time

2. **Use consistent shapes and colors**
   - Same component type = same shape/color
   - Include a legend if needed

3. **Label everything clearly**
   - Component names (what)
   - Technology labels (how)
   - Data flow arrows (direction)

4. **Keep it readable**
   - Max width: 800px
   - Text size: readable at 100% zoom

### ❌ Common Diagram Mistakes

```markdown
# Bad: Too much detail in one diagram
[Diagram with 50 boxes showing every function call]

# Good: Separate concerns
[High-level architecture diagram with 5-6 boxes]
[Detailed sequence diagram for specific flow]
```

## Example: Simple Architecture Doc

```markdown
# Task Queue System Architecture

## Overview
A distributed task queue system that processes background jobs asynchronously.

## Architecture

![Architecture](images/architecture.png)

The system uses a producer-consumer pattern:
- **Producer API** - Accepts tasks from clients
- **Redis Queue** - Stores pending tasks
- **Worker Pool** - Processes tasks
- **Result Store** - Stores completed results

## Data Flow
1. Client submits task via Producer API
2. Task serialized and pushed to Redis queue
3. Workers poll Redis for available tasks
4. Worker processes task and pushes result
5. Client polls for result completion

## Scaling
- Horizontal scaling: Add more workers
- Vertical scaling: Increase worker concurrency
- Queue partitioning: Separate queues by priority

## Technology Choices
- **Redis:** Fast in-memory operations, Pub/Sub support
- **Considered:** RabbitMQ (more features but heavier)
```

## Task 9: Create Diagrams Guide

**Files:**
- Create: `writing-guide/06-diagrams.md`

**Step 1: Create diagrams guide**

```markdown
# Creating Diagrams

When and how to use diagrams effectively.

## Purpose

Diagrams help when:
- Explaining complex relationships
- Showing system architecture
- Illustrating data flows
- Documenting deployment topologies
- Onboarding new developers

## When to Use Diagrams

### ✅ Use Diagrams For:

- System architecture (high-level overview)
- Data flow through components
- Sequence of operations
- Network topology
- Deployment architecture

### ❌ Don't Use For:

- Simple linear processes (text is clearer)
- Implementation details (code comments are better)
- Temporary workarounds (fix the code instead)
- Obsolete architectures (update the diagram)

## Diagram Tools

### draw.io

**Best for:** Architecture diagrams, deployment diagrams, component diagrams

**Advantages:**
- Free and web-based
- Export to multiple formats (PNG, SVG, PDF)
- Version control friendly
- Large library of shapes

**Workflow:**
1. Go to [diagrams.net](https://diagrams.net)
2. Create diagram
3. File → Export as → PNG
4. Save both .drawio source and PNG to your repo

### PlantUML

**Best for:** Sequence diagrams, data flow diagrams, structural diagrams

**Advantages:**
- Text-based (Git friendly)
- Auto-layout
- Consistent styling
- Quick to iterate

**Workflow:**
1. Write PlantUML code
2. Generate PNG: `plantuml file.puml`
3. Commit both .puml and PNG

**Example:**
\`\`\`plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "API Gateway" as API
participant "Auth Service" as Auth
participant "Data Service" as Data

User -> API: Request
API -> Auth: Validate Token
Auth --> API: Valid
API -> Data: Fetch Data
Data --> API: Data
API --> User: Response
@enduml
\`\`\`

## Diagram Standards

### File Naming

Use kebab-case matching the diagram subject:
\`\`\`
images/
├── system-overview.png
├── data-flow.png
├── deployment-architecture.png
└── api-sequence.png
\`\`\`

### File Format

| Format | Use |
|--------|-----|
| **PNG** | Documentation (max width: 800px) |
| **drawio** | Source for draw.io diagrams |
| **puml** | Source for PlantUML diagrams |

**Always commit source files alongside PNGs.**

### Image Size

- **Max width:** 800px for documentation
- **DPI:** 72 or 96 (screen resolution)
- **Theme:** Light theme (works with most doc themes)

### Markdown Syntax

\`\`\`markdown
![Alt text](relative/path/to/image.png)
\`\`\`

## Diagram Types

### System Architecture Diagram

Shows major components and their relationships.

\`\`\`plantuml
@startuml
!include <archimate/Archimate>

header System Architecture

rectangle "Frontend" {
  component [Web App]
  component [Mobile App]
}

rectangle "Backend" {
  component [API Gateway]
  component [Auth Service]
  component [Data Service]
}

database [Database]

[Web App] --> [API Gateway]
[Mobile App] --> [API Gateway]
[API Gateway] --> [Auth Service]
[API Gateway] --> [Data Service]
[Data Service] --> [Database]

@enduml
\`\`\`

### Data Flow Diagram

Shows how data moves through the system.

\`\`\`plantuml
@startuml
header Data Flow

actor "User" as User
queue "Message Queue" as MQ
database "Database" as DB
file "Log File" as Log

User -> MQ: Publish Event
MQ -> DB: Process Event
DB -> Log: Write Record

@enduml
\`\`\`

### Sequence Diagram

Shows the sequence of operations between components.

\`\`\`plantuml
@startuml
header User Authentication Flow

actor User
participant "Web App" as Web
participant "API" as API
participant "Auth DB" as DB

User -> Web: Enter credentials
Web -> API: POST /auth/login
API -> DB: Validate credentials
DB --> API: User data
API --> Web: JWT token
Web --> User: Redirect to dashboard

@enduml
\`\`\`

### Deployment Diagram

Shows deployment topology.

\`\`\`plantuml
@startuml
header Deployment Architecture

node "Production" {
  node "Load Balancer" as LB
  node "App Server 1" as AS1
  node "App Server 2" as AS2
  database "Primary DB" as DB1
  database "Replica DB" as DB2

  LB --> AS1
  LB --> AS2
  AS1 --> DB1
  AS2 --> DB1
  DB1 --> DB2: Replicate
}

@enduml
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

### ✅ Good Diagram Practices

1. **One idea per diagram**
   - Don't overcrowd
   - Use multiple diagrams if needed

2. **Consistent styling**
   - Same shape = same type of component
   - Consistent colors and labels

3. **Clear labels**
   - Label every component
   - Label relationships (arrows)
   - Include a legend if needed

4. **Appropriate detail level**
   - High-level: Major components only
   - Low-level: Single flow or component

### ❌ Common Mistakes

```markdown
# Bad: Too much information
[Diagram showing every single function call and data field]

# Good: Focused on key concepts
[High-level architecture diagram]
[Separate diagram for specific flow]
```

## Example: Documenting with Diagrams

```markdown
## System Architecture

The system consists of three main layers:

![System Architecture](images/architecture.png)

### Components

- **API Gateway:** Routes and validates requests
- **Services:** Business logic microservices
- **Database Layer:** Persistent storage

## Request Flow

![Request Flow](images/request-flow.png)

1. Client sends request to API Gateway
2. Gateway validates authentication
3. Request routed to appropriate service
4. Service queries database
5. Response returned via Gateway
```

```

**Step 2: Commit diagrams guide**

```bash
git add writing-guide/06-diagrams.md
git commit -m "docs: add diagrams guide"
```

## Task 10: Create Style Guide

**Files:**
- Create: `writing-guide/07-style-guide.md`

**Step 1: Create style guide**

```markdown
# Documentation Style Guide

Consistent writing conventions for clear, professional documentation.

## Voice and Tone

### Use Active Voice

**✅ Good:**
\`\`\`markdown
The API validates the token before processing the request.
\`\`\`

**❌ Bad:**
\`\`\`markdown
The token is validated by the API before the request is processed.
\`\`\`

### Use Present Tense

**✅ Good:**
\`\`\`markdown
This function returns the user object.
\`\`\`

**❌ Bad:**
\`\`\`markdown
This function will return the user object.
\`\`\`

### Address the Reader Directly

**✅ Good:**
\`\`\`markdown
To install the package, run npm install.
\`\`\`

**❌ Bad:**
\`\`\`markdown
The user should run npm install to install the package.
\`\`\`

## Headings

### Heading Hierarchy

\`\`\`markdown
# Level 1 - Document title (once per document)
## Level 2 - Main sections
### Level 3 - Subsections
#### Level 4 - Rarely needed
\`\`\`

**Don't skip levels.** Always use H1 → H2 → H3.

### Heading Style

- **Sentence case:** Capitalize only the first word and proper nouns
- **No period:** Headings don't end with punctuation
- **Descriptive:** Headings should describe the content

**✅ Good:**
\`\`\`markdown
## Setting up the development environment
### Installing dependencies
### Configuring the database
\`\`\`

**❌ Bad:**
\`\`\`markdown
## Setting Up The Development Environment.
### INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES
### How To Configure The Database
\`\`\`

## Lists

### Use Bullets for Items Without Order

\`\`\`markdown
Key features:
- Real-time synchronization
- Multi-user support
- Export to PDF
\`\`\`

### Use Numbers for Sequential Steps

\`\`\`markdown
To set up the project:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Configure environment variables
4. Start the development server
\`\`\`

### Parallel Lists

Use sub-bullets or nested numbers:

\`\`\`markdown
Installation steps:

macOS:
1. Install Homebrew
2. Run `brew install node`

Windows:
1. Download installer from nodejs.org
2. Run the installer with default options

Linux:
1. Use your package manager
2. For Ubuntu: `sudo apt install nodejs`
\`\`\`

## Code Blocks

### Always Specify Language

\`\`\`markdown
\`\`\`javascript
const x = 5;
\`\`\`

\`\`\`bash
npm install
\`\`\`

\`\`\`http
GET /api/users
\`\`\`
\`\`\`

### Complete, Working Examples

**✅ Good:**
\`\`\`javascript
// Fetch user data
async function getUser(id) {
  const response = await fetch(\`/api/users/\${id}\`);
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}
\`\`\`

**❌ Bad:**
\`\`\`javascript
// Pseudocode - won't actually work
function getUser(id) {
  // TODO: implement
  return user;
}
\`\`\`

### Include Output Where Helpful

\`\`\`bash
$ npm test

PASS src/auth.test.js
PASS src/api.test.js
Tests: 12 passed, 2 skipped
Time: 2.5s
\`\`\`

## Emphasis

### Use Bold for:
- File names: **README.md**
- UI elements: Click **Save**
- Key terms: **Authentication**

### Use Code (Backticks) for:
- Commands: \`npm install\`
- Variables: \`USER_ID\`
- Code references: \`getUser()\`
- Configuration keys: `database.url`

### Use Italics for:
- New terms: A *webhook* is a...
- Placeholder text: Replace \`YOUR_API_KEY\`

## Links

### Internal Links (Relative)

\`\`\`markdown
See [API Documentation](docs/api.md) for details.
\`\`\`

### External Links

\`\`\`markdown
For more information, visit the [official documentation](https://example.com/docs).
\`\`\`

### Section Anchors

\`\`\`markdown
Jump to [Authentication](#authentication)
\`\`\`

## Terminology

### Consistent Product/Feature Names

Establish canonical names and use them consistently:

| Term | Use | Don't Use |
|------|-----|-----------|
| User API | User API | user-api, userAPI, USER_API |
| Authenticate | authenticate | login, log in, signin |
| Endpoint | endpoint | route, path, URL |

### Acronyms

Define acronyms on first use:

\`\`\`markdown
The User Management Service (UMS) handles user accounts.
The UMS validates credentials before creating accounts.
\`\`\`

### Technical Terms

Explain or link technical terms:

\`\`\`markdown
The system uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
\`\`\`

or

\`\`\`markdown
The system uses [JWT](https://jwt.io) for authentication.
\`\`\`

## Punctuation

### Periods

- **Use periods:** Complete sentences
- **No periods:** Headings, list items (unless complete sentences)

### Commas

Use the Oxford comma in lists:

\`\`\`markdown
The system supports JSON, XML, and YAML formats.
\`\`\`

### Colons

Use colons to introduce:
- Code blocks
- Lists
- Examples

\`\`\`markdown
Install the dependencies:
\`\`\`bash
npm install
\`\`\`
\`\`\`

## Numbers

### Spell Out 0-10

\`\`\`markdown
one, two, three, ... ten
11, 12, 13, ...
\`\`\`

**Exception:** Use numerals for:
- Versions: Node.js 18
- Measurements: 500ms timeout
- Code: port 3000
- Data: 50 users

## Formatting Tables

### Column Headers

\`\`\`markdown
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| name | string | Yes | User's name |
| age | number | No | User's age |
\`\`\`

### Alignment

Left-align text, right-align numbers:

\`\`\`markdown
| Feature | Status | Count |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Auth | Done | 5 |
| API | In Progress | 12 |
\`\`\`

## Notes, Warnings, and Tips

Use blockquotes for special callouts:

\`\`\`markdown
> **Note:** This feature requires version 2.0 or higher.

> **Warning:** Deleting a user cannot be undone.

> **Tip:** Use \`--help\` flag to see all options.
\`\`\`

## Accessibility

### Alt Text for Images

\`\`\`markdown
