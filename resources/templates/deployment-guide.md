```bash
# Deploy infrastructure
cd infrastructure
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Build Process

### Local Build

npm run lint

# Run tests
npm test

# Build application
npm run build

# Output: dist/ directory
```

Builds are automatically triggered on:
- Push to `main` branch
- Pull request creation
- Manual trigger via [CI/CD platform]

**Build Steps:**
1. Checkout code
2. Install dependencies
3. Run linter
4. Run tests
5. Build artifacts
6. Push to registry
7. Deploy to environment

### Build Artifacts

| Configuration | `config/` | Environment configs |
| Documentation | `docs/` | Generated docs |

## Deployment Procedures

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying, verify:

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] CHANGELOG updated
- [ ] Migration scripts prepared
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Stakeholders notified
- [ ] Maintenance window scheduled (if needed)

### Development Deployment

**Trigger:** Automatic on push to `develop` branch

```bash
# Manual deployment
./scripts/deploy-dev.sh

# Or via CI/CD
# Navigate to: [CI/CD platform]
# Trigger: deploy-dev job
```

**Process:**
1. Build application
2. Run tests
3. Deploy to development environment
4. Run smoke tests
5. Notify team of deployment status

### Staging Deployment

**Trigger:** Manual via CI/CD or after merge to `main`

```bash
# Deploy to staging
./scripts/deploy-staging.sh

# Or via CI/CD
# Trigger: deploy-staging job
```

**Process:**
1. Build application
2. Run full test suite
3. Deploy to staging environment
4. Run integration tests
5. Run E2E tests
6. Generate deployment report

### Production Deployment

**Trigger:** Manual approval required

```bash
# Deploy to production
./scripts/deploy-production.sh

# Or via CI/CD
# Trigger: deploy-production job
# Requires approval
```

**Process:**
1. Create git tag for release
2. Build production artifacts
3. Run full test suite
4. Deploy to production (canary deployment)
5. Monitor canary metrics
6. Full rollout if metrics healthy
7. Run smoke tests
8. Verify deployment

#### Production Deployment Steps

```bash
# 1. Create release tag
git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release v1.2.3"
git push origin v1.2.3

# 2. Deploy (canary)
./scripts/deploy-production.sh --canary --percent 10

# 3. Monitor canary (10 minutes)
# Check metrics: [monitoring dashboard]

# 4. Full rollout
./scripts/deploy-production.sh --rollout

# 5. Verify deployment
curl https://example.com/health
```

### Database Migrations

```bash
# Run migrations before deployment
npm run db:migrate:up

# Rollback if needed
npm run db:migrate:down
```

**Migration Guidelines:**
- Create backward-compatible migrations
- Test migrations on staging first
- Have rollback script ready
- Never delete columns/tables in same migration

## Post-Deployment

### Verification Steps

After deployment, verify:

1. **Health Check**
   ```bash
   curl https://example.com/health
   # Expected: {"status":"ok"}
   ```

2. **API Endpoints**
   ```bash
   # Test key endpoints
   curl https://example.com/api/v1/resource
   ```

3. **Database Connectivity**
   ```bash
   # Verify database connection
   npm run db:check
   ```

4. **Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Check error rates
   - Verify response times
   - Confirm active connections

5. **Smoke Tests**
   ```bash
   npm run test:smoke
   ```

### Performance Validation

Compare post-deployment metrics to baseline:

| Metric | Baseline | Post-Deployment | Status |
|--------|----------|-----------------|--------|
| Response Time (P95) | [value] | [value] | [✓/✗] |
| Error Rate | [value] | [value] | [✓/✗] |
| Throughput | [value] | [value] | [✓/✗] |

### Notification

Notify stakeholders of deployment completion:

```
Subject: Deployment Complete - v1.2.3

Environment: Production
Version: v1.2.3

Deployed by: [Name]
Deployed at: [Timestamp]

Changes:
- Feature 1
- Bug fix 2
- Performance improvement 3

Verification:
- All health checks passing
- Error rates within normal range
- No critical alerts

Next steps:

[Link to deployment details]
```

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback

Automatic rollback is triggered if:

- Error rate exceeds [X]%
- Response time exceeds [Y]ms
- Health check fails [Z] consecutive times

### Manual Rollback

```bash
# Rollback to previous version
./scripts/rollback-production.sh

# Rollback to specific version
./scripts/rollback-production.sh --version v1.2.2

# Rollback database migrations
npm run db:migrate:rollback
```

### Rollback Decision Tree

```
Deployment Issue Detected
  │
  ├─ Is issue critical?
  │   ├─ Yes → Immediate rollback
  │   └─ No → Can it be hotfixed?
  │       ├─ Yes → Deploy hotfix
  │       └─ No → Rollback
  │
  └─ Is issue affecting users?
      ├─ Yes → Rollback immediately
      └─ No → Monitor and evaluate
```

### Rollback Verification

After rollback, verify:

1. Application health restored
2. Error rates normalized
3. User-facing issues resolved
4. No data corruption

## Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

#### Issue: Deployment fails with dependency error

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npm run build
```

#### Issue: Health check fails after deployment

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check application logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/app

# Check database connectivity
kubectl exec -it pod-name -- npm run db:check

# Restart deployment
kubectl rollout restart deployment/app
```

#### Issue: High memory usage after deployment

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check resource usage
kubectl top pods

# Scale deployment
kubectl scale deployment app --replicas=4

# Adjust resource limits
# Update deployment configuration
```
