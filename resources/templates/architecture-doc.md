## System Overview

[Provide a high-level overview of the system, its purpose, and main architectural style.]

![System Overview](images/system-overview.png)

The system is built using a [microservices/monolithic/layered] architecture designed to:

- [Key requirement 1]
- [Key requirement 2]
- [Key requirement 3]

## Architecture Principles

Our architecture follows these principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility
   - Clear boundaries between layers and modules

2. **Scalability**
   - Horizontal scaling of stateless services
   - Independent scaling of components based on load

3. **High Availability**
   - No single points of failure
   - Graceful degradation

4. **Modularity**
   - Loose coupling between components
   - Well-defined interfaces

5. **Observability**
   - Comprehensive logging and metrics
   - Distributed tracing
